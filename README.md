## SDN Introduction
SDN, Software Defined Network
basically using the software to control the hardware within the network system to have better network performance.

### Why SDN?
1. The closed systems in the network system devices (routers, switches):
   --> make the web administrators spending time on getting used to different systems provided by different suppliers
   --> unable to flexibly adjust (may have to shut down the network service to change the settings or protocol)

2. The network environment nowadays
   --> Interent Ossification: the network system devices just like our bone or the traffic system in our lives would exist very long time.
   --> Highly Internet usage, people can't live without the Internet
   
‚óè That comes the SDN:
  Using software to remotely control the control plan
